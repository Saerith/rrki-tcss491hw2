Click to spawn bubbles.

Mass is determined by radius, so large bubbles are less affected by small bubbles when colliding and visa versa. They're also subject to a terminal velocity based on their mass which gives them a "floaty" feel, similar to how small bubbles seem to stay in the air longer and are more affected by air current.
